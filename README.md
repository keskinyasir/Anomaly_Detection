# Anomaly_Detection

This project is about Anomaly Detection with S&P500 time series data.

 - Build an LSTM(Long Short - Term Memory) Autoencoder.
 - Detect anomalies with LSTM Autoencoder with time series data(S&P500)
 - Create interactive charts and plots with Plotly and Seaborn
 
If you want to see interactive graphs and plots, you need to open this project with https://colab.research.google.com/
